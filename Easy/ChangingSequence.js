/*
 * CODERBYTE CHANGING SEQUENCE CHALLENGE
 *
 * Problem Statement
 * Have the function ChangingSequence(arr) take the array of
 * numbers stored in arr and return the index at which the
 * numbers stop increasing and begin decreasing or stop
 * decreasing and begin increasing.
 * For example: if arr is [1, 2, 4, 6, 4, 3, 1] then your
 * program should return 3 because 6 is the last point in the
 * array where the numbers were increasing and the next number
 * begins a decreasing sequence. The array will contain at least
 * 3 numbers and it may contains only a single sequence,
 * increasing or decreasing. If there is only a single sequence
 * in the array, then your program should return -1.
 * Indexing should begin with 0.
 *
 * Examples
 * Input 1: [-4, -2, 9, 10]
 * Output 1: -1
 *
 * Input 2: [5, 4, 3, 2, 10, 11]
 * Output 2: 3
 *

// Test cases
console.log(ChangingSequence([1, 2, 4, 6, 4, 3, 1])); // Output: 3
console.log(ChangingSequence([-4, -2, 9, 10])); // Output: -1
console.log(ChangingSequence([5, 4, 3, 2, 10, 11])); // Output: 3
console.log(ChangingSequence([-9, 0, 3, 2, -6, -7])); // Output: 2
